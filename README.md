# End2End Protein Docking

## A pipeline for docking protein structures

This repository incorporates a number of :

- [Evolutionary Scale Modeling](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm)
- [SidechainNet](https://github.com/jonathanking/sidechainnet)
- [Massively Parallel Natural Extension of Reference Frame](https://github.com/EleutherAI/mp_nerf)
- [Axial-Attention](https://github.com/lucidrains/En-transformer/)
- [En-Transformer](https://github.com/lucidrains/En-transformer/)
- [Graph-Transformer](https://github.com/lucidrains/graph-transformer-pytorch)
- [E3NN](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn)

For experimental and prototypical access to internal code, these repos are collected under `building_blocks` (except sidechainnet). As development progresses they will be incorporated as original `imports`.


## Experiments

### Phase I: Topography
